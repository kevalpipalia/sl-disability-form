**Symptoms related to the situation**
Experienced symptoms "Since November, she has been working up to 70 (even 100) hours at Disney, and it's very stressful. There are several departures in the teams, and she no longer has time to manage. She describes her brain like a computer where she can't close the windows: -sleep: she is exhausted and her eyes close, but her brain never stops. She has headaches as a result. She is unable to stop thinking (since January 2023) -appetite: for a few weeks, she hasn't taken the time to eat. She describes her appetite as 60% of normal -concentration: at work, she is good, but as soon as she is in a less demanding situation, she is in her bubble and not present, even when watching TV -anxiety about not being able to cope or forgetting something. It's more to try to "keep it together" despite everything. Every week, the stress is much greater. Strategies: sleep more, but she can't. She thinks she is close to a nervous breakdown: she has difficulty finding pleasure in things she loved before, even playing with her children.
